# `cd`

The `cd` command allows us to change the current working directory to a specific folder or path. This command is followed by the name of the folder which we would like to move into.

 > Since I have not provided any argument after `cd`, the current working directory does not change. The current working directory remains `/home`.

![Image](cd_file.png)
> The `cd` command does not accept a file as an argument. Here I have provided `Hello.java` as the argument and therefore it has caused an error. Hence the current working directory does not change.

![Image](cd_folder.png)
> Here the `cd` command is followed by the path of the folder `/lecture1/`. This is an acceptable argument. Therefore, the current working directory changes to `/home/lecture1/`.

# `ls`

---
# `cat`
