# Lab Report 4

# Step 1 - Log into ieng6

> To log into ieng6 I typed `ssh rsrikanth@ieng6.ucsd.edu`. I wasn't prompted to enter my password because I have set up the SSH key with my computer.

# Step 2 - Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account 

> Firstly, I typed out `rm -rf l<tab>` which tab completes the command to `rm -rf lab7/`. This deletes the lab7/ directory which is currently in my ieng6  account. Then I ran the command `git clone git@github.com:Ridzz23/lab7.git` to clone my fork of the `lab7` repository.
